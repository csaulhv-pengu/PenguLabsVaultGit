As we learnt in school, **ideal** projectile motion can be represented considering this model (for 2D and idealized):

Initial speed is $v_0(\theta)$ and depends on the angle $\alpha$.

We can calculate the point where the ball will impact considering this initial factor a constant force of gravity $g$.

As per your physics notebook:
**Position:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
x(t) &= v_0 \cos(\theta)\, t \\
y(t) &= v_0 \sin(\theta)\, t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\end{aligned}
$$

**Velocity:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
x'(t) &= v_0 \cos(\theta) \\
y'(t) &= v_0 \sin(\theta) - g\,t
\end{aligned}
$$

**Acceleration:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
x''(t) &= 0 \\
y''(t) &= -g
\end{aligned}
$$

**From Position:**
$$t_f = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$$
​

Where:
$v_0$: initial projectile speed
$\theta$: initial angle (ground / velocity vector)
$g$: gravity constant $9.81 m/s^2$ on earth
$t$: time
$t_f$: time when projectile touch the ground
$x(t)$: position in x axis when time is $t$
$y(t)$: position in y axis when time is $t$
