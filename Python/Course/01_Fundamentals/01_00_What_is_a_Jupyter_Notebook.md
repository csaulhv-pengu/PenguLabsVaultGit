# Jupyter Notebook
![[Pasted image 20260104171348.png]]

We will start learning using Jupyter Notebook instead of directly writing Python code in a .py file.
## What is a Jupyter Notebook?
A Jupyter Notebook is an **interactive document** where you can:

- Write code
- Execute it step by step
- See the output **immediately** below

Extension: .ipynb

> It is not just a code file, it is a **learning and experimentation tool**.

## Why use Jupyter Notebooks for learning Python?

- Immediate feedback
- No need to write full programs
- Perfect for experiments and small examples
- Widely used in education, science and data analysis

> Jupyter is designed to help you _think with code_.

> Notebooks are for learning and exploration, scripts are for building software.
