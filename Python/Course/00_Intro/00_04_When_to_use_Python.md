- Python is a tool
- It is not the best choice for everything
- Choosing the right tool matters

## When Python is a good choice

### Learning programming
- Simple syntax
- Focus on concepts
- Fast feedback

---

### Automation and scripting
- File processing
- Repetitive tasks
- System automation

---

### Prototyping ideas
- Quick experiments
- Proof of concepts
- Early-stage development

---

### Science and engineering
- Math and physics simulations
- Data analysis
- Machine learning

---

## Why Python works well in these cases
- Readable code
- Huge library ecosystem
- Strong community support

---

## When Python is NOT the best choice

### Performance-critical systems
- Real-time systems
- Game engines
- Low-level software

---

### Embedded and hardware-level code
- Limited resources
- Direct hardware control required

---

## Python in real-world projects
- Often used with other languages
- Python for logic and glue code
	- C / C++ / Rust for performance
