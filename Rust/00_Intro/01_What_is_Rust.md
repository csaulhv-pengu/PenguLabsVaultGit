# Rust
## 1. What is Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language designed to be fast, memory-safe, and concurrent, without using a garbage collector.

**In simple terms:**  
Rust forces you to think about memory ownership so that many bugs are caught at compile time instead of runtime.  
It aims to offer performance similar to C/C++, but with more modern tooling and safety guarantees.

---
## Why learn Rust?
Rust is worth learning because it solves problems that many developers face in real-world software.

Some reasons to learn Rust:
- It prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time (null pointers, data races).
- It offers C/C++-level performance without a garbage collector.
- It is used in production by major companies.
- Learning Rust makes you a better programmer, even in other languages.

---
## Where does Rust come from?
Rust was originally created by Graydon Hoare in 2006 as a personal project.
Later, Mozilla sponsored its development to build safer and more reliable systems software.

The first stable release of Rust (1.0) was released in 2015.
Since then, Rust has grown into a mature and widely adopted language.

---
## Is Rust open source?
Yes. Rust is completely open source.
- The compiler and tooling are free to use.
- There are no licenses to buy.
- Development is driven by an open community.
- Anyone can contribute to the language.

---
## Where is Rust used?
Rust is used in many areas of modern software development, including:

- Operating systems and low-level tools
- Web servers and backend services
- Embedded systems
- Game engines
- Command-line tools

Some companies using Rust include:
- Mozilla
- Microsoft
- Amazon
- Google
- Discord

---
## What can I build with Rust?
With Rust, you can build:

- Fast command-line tools
- Backend services and APIs
- Game engines and tools
- System utilities
- Cross-platform applications

In this series, I will start from zero and build small, practical projects while learning the language.
